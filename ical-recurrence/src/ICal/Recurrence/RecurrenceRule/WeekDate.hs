-- | Calculate the year, week number and weekday of a day, given a day on which the week starts

-- The BYWEEKNO rule part specifies a COMMA-separated list of
-- ordinals specifying weeks of the year.  Valid values are 1 to 53
-- or -53 to -1.  This corresponds to weeks according to week
-- numbering as defined in [ISO.8601.2004].  A week is defined as a
-- seven day period, starting on the day of the week defined to be
-- the week start (see WKST).  Week number one of the calendar year
-- is the first week that contains at least four (4) days in that
-- calendar year.
--
--    Note: Assuming a Monday week start, week 53 can only occur when
--    Thursday is January 1 or if it is a leap year and Wednesday is
--    January 1.
--
-- This means that in 2015, when Jan 1st was a thursday:
-- - with a week start of Monday, the first week started on 29 dec 2014
-- - with a week start of Sunday, the first week started on 4 jan 2015

-- We want to know whethere the first 'ws' occurs in the first week of
-- this year or in the last week of last year
-- Example: If the first 'ws' occurs on jan 1st then it's easy because
-- then it's definitely the first week of this year beacuse then all 7
-- days of that week are in this year.
-- To make sure that four of the days in the week that started on the
-- 'ws' week that contains jan 1, the 'ws' of that week must have
-- occurred on or after the third-to-last day of the previous year.
-- In that case the first week started in the previous year.
-- If that 'ws' occurred before the third-to-last day of the previous year,
-- then the first week started in the current year.
-- The third-to-last day of the previous year is always 29 dec, even in
-- leap years
--
-- For example, if Jan 1st is a thursday then the first monday-week of the year started this year
-- but if Jan 1st is a Wednesday then the first monday-week of the year started last year
--
-- If the 'firstDayOfTheWSWeekThatContainsJan1st' is on or after dec 29
-- then it is the first day of the first ws week otherwise, the first
-- week starts a week later.
